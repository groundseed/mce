# mce
A web interface for downloading Google Chrome extensions with IDs.  
I made this pretty much for school as I dont use Chrome outside of it.  
Chrome Version shouldnt matter too much, just follow the format and enter modern versions.  
  
The code for this isn't good.
## purpose
I made a primitive version of this when I was annoyed with Chrome extensions at school.  
So I came home and improved it. Here it is.  
## hosting and licensing
I intentionally didn't add a license to this because it isn't too important to me.  
If you're going to host this yourself, just credit me. But honestly, if you we're planning on hosting this, just don't, the code is horrid.  
I might shove this on my website in the future but I do not care for it right now.
