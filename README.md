A web interface for downloading Google Chrome extensions with IDs.  
I made this pretty much for school as I dont use Chrome outside of it.  
Chrome Version shouldnt matter too much, just follow the format and enter modern versions.  
## purpose
I made a primitive version of this when I was annoyed with Chrome extensions at school.  
So I came home and improved it. Here it is.
